  This file is a quick reference on Cleo config fuile (cleo.conf)

  Config file is separated on several sections. Section names are
written in square bracets, e.g. [users]. First section MUST be
'server'.

  [server] section describes global options and modes. [users] section
describes users options. [clusters] section describes queues nodes and
queues options. [profiles] section defines custom execution 'profiles',
e.g. method to run non-mpi executables. You can use them in mpirun by
passing key '-as profilename'. [clusterusers] defines options for
users or groups in several queues. [groups] section defines custom user
groups. These groups can be used in all config instrusions as user name
by adding '+'. E.g.: admins = +adm_group.

  Cleo supports queues hierarhy. Top queue MUST be named 'main'. Top
queue can be divided on several queues. E.g. you have nodes n1,n2,n3 and n4.
You want to use n1,n2,n3 for main computations and n4 for testing.
Define queue main as n1..n4, then queue comp as n1,n2,n3 and then
queue test as n4.
  You can use ANY queue of main, comp or test. If you add task to main,
this task will be placed on comp and test too. When comp ant test will
be ready to get nodes for this task, and main will get sufficient
nodes to run it, task will be runned.
  Queues hierarhy is defined by queue.parent directive (see below).

  All directives in config file are in form: 'name = value' or in
form: 'prefix.name = value'. Prefix is used for instructions per
user or queue, etc. E.g. queue nodes are defined as
queuename.pe = n1 n2 n3 n4

  List values can be delimited by ','.

  On several valuse uou can user variables. These variables will be
substituted in place. E.g.:
exec_line = /usr/bin/mpirun2 -np $np $task

  Here $np will be replace by actual number of processes and $task
will be replaced by executable file name and its arguments.

  All time intrvals are in seconds.
